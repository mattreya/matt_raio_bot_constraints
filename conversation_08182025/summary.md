## Conversation Summary - August 18, 2025

We reviewed the entire project, understanding its structure and the purpose of each file. The project serves as a base for custom slash commands for the Gemini CLI, with existing commands for web search, security scanning, and informational content.

We then proceeded to add a new slash command called `/rollback`. This command is designed to revert the last change made to the project. The implementation involves:

1.  **Creating `rollback.toml`**: A new TOML file in `.gemini/commands/` to define the `/rollback` command.
2.  **Implementing `rollback()` in `slash_commands.py`**: This Python function will execute `git revert HEAD --no-edit` to revert the last Git commit.
3.  **Updating `README.md`**: The project's `README.md` file was updated to include the new `/rollback` command in the list of available slash commands.

This approach assumes that "the latest change" refers to the last Git commit, as a more granular rollback mechanism would require a more complex system for tracking individual changes and their previous states.
