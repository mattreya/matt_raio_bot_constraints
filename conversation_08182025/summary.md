## Conversation Summary - August 18, 2025

This conversation focused on creating a new slash command for error log triage.

**Key Actions:**

1.  **Project Evaluation:** Reviewed `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `scraper.py`, and `slash_commands.py` to understand the project's context and conventions.
2.  **`triage_error.py` Creation:** A Python script (`triage_error.py`) was created to parse error logs, identify key information (error type, message, context), and generate a Slack-ready summary.
3.  **`/triage` Slash Command Definition:** A new TOML file (`.gemini/commands/triage.toml`) was created to define the `/triage` command. This command takes an `error_log` as input and executes `triage_error.py`.
4.  **Usage Explanation:** Provided instructions and an example for using the new `/triage` command.

**New Slash Command:** `/triage`

**Purpose:** Triages an error log and prepares a summary for Slack.

**Usage Example:**

```
/triage error_log="""
2025-08-18 10:30:00,123 ERROR [main] com.example.MyService - Failed to connect to database.
java.sql.SQLException: Connection refused (Connection refused)
    at com.example.MyService.connect(MyService.java:123)
    at com.example.MyService.init(MyService.java:45)

```
